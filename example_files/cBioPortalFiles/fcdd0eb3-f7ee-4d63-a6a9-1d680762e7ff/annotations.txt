These cases are a part of the TARGET-ALL-P1 study but since the related aliquots underwent sequencing at the same time as a TARGET-ALL-P2 set, these cases had previously been inadvertently grouped with that project. Please note that these cases and some associated data will still appear in TARGET-ALL-P2 in the GDC Legacy Archive. For additional information, please contact ocg@mail.nih.gov.
